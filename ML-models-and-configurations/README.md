# Althos ML Models & AI Components

This directory contains all machine learning models, AI configurations, and related documentation for the Althos Mental Wellness Platform prototype. Our ML pipeline integrates multiple advanced models to provide empathetic, culturally-sensitive mental health support for Indian youth.

## Model Overview

- **Distress Detection**: Real-time classification of mental health crisis indicators
- **Mood Clustering**: Unsupervised pattern recognition in emotional states
- **AI Coaching**: Vertex AI-powered empathetic response generation
- **Text Summarization**: Weekly wellness report generation
- **Text-to-Speech**: Audio narration for accessibility and engagement

## Architecture

All models are deployed on Google Cloud Platform using Vertex AI endpoints for scalable, real-time inference. The pipeline processes user journal entries, mood logs, and assessment data to provide personalized mental health insights.

## Data Privacy

All models are designed with privacy-first architecture. Personal data is anonymized during training, and inference occurs on encrypted endpoints with audit logging.

## Getting Started

Refer to individual model documentation files for specific implementation details, training procedures, and deployment instructions.

## Contributing

This is a prototype implementation. Production-ready models would require additional training data, validation studies, and clinical supervision.
